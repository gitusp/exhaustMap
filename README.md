# most-package-seed

A starter kit for a most/core package.

## What it does out of the box

- Compiles TypeScript, generates typings
- Builds CommonJS and ES2015 modules, and also UMD module (you know, for CDNs)
- Runs tests with Mocha (and `power-assert`)

## How to use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Edit git remote.
3. Edit `package.json` (don’t forget to rename the package and remove `"private": true`).
4. Edit `README.md` for good measure.
5. You’re ready to code.

## What it lacks

Flow types generation is missing, even though they probably can be converted from the TS typings.
